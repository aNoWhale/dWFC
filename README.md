# Optimization for metamaterial based on WFC


# environment
* the project was based on Linux(ubuntu) default.
* the uv was employed to control the environment.
```shell
uv sync #to sync the requirements
```
* to add packages:
```shell
uv add [package]
```
* and also another method to add packages:
```shell
uv pip install [package]
```
* but in this way, the uv may not maintain the requirements automatically.
## tips:
* also, some packages like pytorch needs more configuration to work with uv.
